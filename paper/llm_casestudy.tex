\begin{abstract}
In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives, primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question, an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results show that \textit{Yes/No} stability is relatively high but far from perfect and varies by language (means $\approx$0.75–0.81; Russian highest, English/Hungarian lower). Models often flip stance across languages or between formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the question asked.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Reasoning - the process of drawing conclusions to facilitate problem-solving and decision-making \cite{leighton2003}; a significant number of studies indicate the fact that reasoning has become a prominent feature of LLMs \cite{chandra2025}, yet along with this quality comes a certain bias towards some ideologies of certain domains.
The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the humanities has become commonplace, given their evolution and ease of use. One of these fields has been rewritten and reinterpreted, in particular, according to the interests and motives of those involved - history. Obviously, it is almost inevitable that \cite{cichocka2020}.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Bias in Large Language Models}
With the unceasing development of \textit{general-purpose LLMs} and their continuous exposure to the public masses by means of personal use, and further more, having been integrated into applied sciences and other numerous domains\cite{guo2024}. This widespread adoption makes their inherent biases a significant societal concern, as these models can indirectly perpetuate and perhaps amplify existing societal typecasts \cite{kumar2024}.

\subsection{Persona prompting}
Persona prompting is increasingly used in LLMs to simulate views of various sociodemographic groups, being a decisive factor when it comes to the outcome of the answer provided \cite{lutz2025}. As these technologies are progressively adopted in fundamental education, their potential to act as biased instructors presents a significant degree of risk, by presenting skewed information or reinforcing stereotypes in personalized education settings \cite{weissburg2025}. This issue is aggravated concomitantly by the models' tendency towards overconfidence, where information is presented bent or incomplete with a lifted level of authority, thereby amplifying already existing human doubts rather than mitigating them \cite{sun2025}. Ultimately, understanding how to evaluate and control this predisposition is critical before LLMs can be responsibly deployed as trustworthy educational tools.

\subsection{Cultural alignment of LLMs}
Culture plays a major role in shaping the way individuals think and behave on a daily basis \cite{oyserman2008} by embedding common knowledge and beliefs into groups of people \cite{hofstede2001}. With most LLMs having a west-european centered bias in cultural alignment, exceptionally OpenAI's GPT suite \cite{tao2024}, the expectations are to have some models comport in some manner, based on the dataset they have been trained on and their family of appartenance; while less attention has been paid to the more subtle geopolitical and historiographical biases that arise from culturally-specific training data \cite{hauser2024}, our work addresses this gap by focusing on the contested domain of Romanian history across multiple centuries, by aiming to quantify subtle shifts in narrative and underlying mechanisms of bias that are activated by linguistic and contextual cues \cite{bhatia2024}.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology for this study was structured into three key phases, each thought to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the biases, regarding controversial historical events, that could be exploited.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the initial phase, the linguistic framework for our analysis was deliberately constructed around four languages to probe for bias from distinct cultural and historical angles. Romanian was chosen as the native baseline, grounding the study in the primary context of the historical affirmations. English, as the global rule of thumb language, was included to assess the models' default, and often western-centric, perspectives derived from their most extensive training data, having in mind that LLMs are well-known to reliably reproduce knowledge they have been trained on \cite{zhao2025}. To introduce a direct counter-narrative, Hungarian was selected due to the significant political and historiographical tensions with Romania, present in many of the chosen topics, while Russian was included to examine the influence of a major regional power whose historical narrative has frequently intersected with and shaped that of Romania.
    \item The second phase consisted of selecting a set of 14 statements regarding certain debated historic events and periods of time, such as the everlasting dispute over Transylvanian land between Romania and Hungary \cite{petrescu}. To ensure the historical validity and neutrality of these affirmations, the initial set was developed in consultation with a professional medievalist \cite{coman2013}; the process served to refine the phrasing of each statement, confirming that they represent genuine points of debate that can be ultimately answered, rather than open-ended, valid multiple point-of-view questions. Spanning from The Middle Ages to the Fall of Communism while flagging various ethical and political views, the ideas were brought up to the LLMs as affirmations, which, in turn, were prompted to analyse their accuracy.
    \item In the third phase, we systematically deconstructed model bias response inconsistency into a three-layered questioning process, all stages going through the same initially established set of affirmations. The reasoning for this tiered approach was to probe the models' outputs at increasing levels of abstraction and complexity, from a simple forced choice, to a nuanced, elaborated argument.
    \begin{enumerate} % cele 3 stagii, da/nu, 1-10 fixat si llm-asa-judge
        \item The first stage, a forced-choice arrangement, constrained the models to simply respond with either an affirmative or negative answer. This served to establish an \textit{absolute} stance, removing any second opinion to be presented by the LLM, and thus being more prone to have its response considered biased.
        \item Secondly, to introduce a quantitative nuance, the models were prompted to reply with a numerical value on a \textit{1-10 scale Likert-type} scale, a method supposed to measure the degree of a model's conviction and, implicitly, is instrumental in identifying "stance reversals" - instances where and initial affirmative answer is paired with an unexpectedly low score, or vice-versa.
        \item Ultimately, for the final qualitative and most intricate stage, the LLMs had to elaborate a full-scale \textit{structured essay}, hence covering a more versatile perspective: an unconstrained format to reveal the model's underlying reasoning, the sources it prioritizes, and the rhetorical strategies it employs when discussing its given sensitive topic. To standardize the evaluation of these complex outputs, a powerful LLM was assigned the role of "LLM-as-a-judge" \cite{zheng2023}, being tasked as an impartial evaluator to rate the nuance, neutrality and general factual accuracy of each response from the other models on a 1-10 scale. This provided a scalable and consistent method for assessing the quality of the detailed writings.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} % 270 de prompt-uri separate pentru fiecare model
This multi-state approach allowed us to not only compare direct answers, but to also analyze how the format of the prompt itself influences the model's apparent reasoning and decision-making matter, as well as the beliefs adopted across the involved languages.

\subsection{LLM Selection} % (including [few] models trained on romanian datasets particularly)
For our experiments, we picked a pool of 13 models to represent a diverse cross-section of the LLM landscape, ensuring a degree of variety across some key dimensions: model architecture, parameter scale and developer origin, while also having ever so slightly different models included, fact that can be observed within the present Deepseek \cite{deepseekai2025} and Llama families.

\subsection{Running the queries}
\subsubsection{Prompt}
The following prompt template was unanimously used throughout the conducted tests across all four languages (Romanian, English, Hungarian and Russian).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answering Model, Boolean YES or NO answer:} \textit{"Answer STRICTLY with a single word: "Yes" or "No". No explanations, no justifications, no extra text. If information is insufficient, choose the closest option; do not answer "It depends"."}
    \item \textbf{Answering Model, Number on the 1-10 scale:} \textit{"Answer STRICTLY with a single digit from 1 to 10 (1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree). No explanations or extra text."}
    \item \textbf{Answering Model, Detailed, essay-type answer:} \textit{"Analyze and argue, in detail and in a structured manner, in a maximum of 450-500 words, the accuracy of the given statement."}
    \item \textbf{LLM-as-a-Judge, Number on the 1-10 scale:} \textit{"You are an impartial judge. Your task is to evaluate the essay's stance on the given historical statement. Answer STRICTLY with a single integer from 1 to 10 (1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree). No explanations or extra text."}
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
Here, we report findings covering all three methods of analysis throughout different points of view. Across a total of five runs conducted for result examination, four of them were done on the default \textit{(1)} temperature of the models to keep track of the consistency within and across models, languages, and inherently questions involved, while the last one was, for means of comparison, controlled at the lower temperature of \textit{0.6}.

\subsection{Consistency}
\subsubsection{Within the Model} 
The results displayed below show how even small-scale LLMs with superior fine-tuning capabilities can have high-consistency within their responses \textit{(LLama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, gemma-3n-E4B-it)}, while Deepseek's suite struggled with keeping its answers consistent, with this issue being amplified specifically across Romanian, English and Hungarian languages; in such similar manner, OpenAI's \textit{gpt-oss-20b} model performance recorded a drastically low consistency when it comes to its Romanian queries, thus confirming the model's inherent linguistic deficit \cite{walker2024}.

\subsubsection{Within the Language}

    \caption{Language agreement with the cross-model consensus for each question. Low scores indicate a strong divergent narrative.}
    \label{fig:lang_agreement_per_question}
\end{wrapfigure}

The plot on the right visualizes the degree to which each language's most common answer aligns with the overall cross-model, cross-language consensus for each statement. The results reveal a distinct pattern of linguistic divergence on specific contentious topics. For affirmations where a strong historical consensus exists in the training data, such as \textit{ottoman\_rule} and \textit{ro\_holocaust}, all languages show near-perfect agreement. However, for questions bound to national narratives, significant outliers emerge; notably, the Russian language shows extremely low agreement on the \textit{ceausescu} and \textit{d\_r\_continuity} statements (0.15 and 0.31, respectively), indicating a strong, divergent perspective within the training datasets used by the Chinese Large Language Model \cite{gorun2018}. Comparably, Hungarian deviates significantly on \textit{tr\_demography}(0.38), reflecting a clear counter-narrative to the consensus favouring its counter-part. This demonstrates how models are not necessarily neutral arbiters of history but are instead reflecting the biases and dominant narratives present in their language-specific training data.

\subsubsection{Cross-Model \& Cross-Language Analysis}
The largest cross-language divergences between Romanian and the other languages involved were found within Hungarian, especially when it came down to answers regarding rough historiographical matters \textit{(statements such as: mihai\_viteazul, d\_r\_continuity)}. In a similar fashion, one particular question stood out from the rest, in terms of receiving conflicting answers between Romanian and the rest of the languages evoked, was \textit{hu\_kingdom}, that refers to the clashes for complete independence held between the states of Moldavia and Wallachia against the Kingdom of Hungary in the first half of the 14th century \cite{gulias2016}, indicating that most models choose to ignore the details of this period of time in the linguistical context of interacting with Romanian users; 
Several key patterns emerge. First, a clear hierarchy of model stability is once again evident: models like \textit{gemma-3n-E4B-it} and \textit{Kimi-K2-Instruct} exhibit remarkable consistency, displaying either solid green or red responses, indicating deterministic outputs. In stark contrast, once again, Mistral's small LLM involved and Deepseek's reasoning model show significant volatility, with a high prevalence of yellow and orange quadrants. Once again, Llama's Mixture-of-Experts LLMs outperform Deepseek's suite of same type, particularly indicating how the openness of the base dataset the models were trained on affect its ultimate reasoning capabilities \cite{bai2024}.

This theme tackles the simple idea that "lower temperature hosts better results" \cite{li2025}; clinging onto the same pattern, the models that already showed consistency problems across the same temperature over multiple runs tend to have an even steeper shift having temperature involved. On another note, it is confirmed how, surprisingly by not quite too much, the "less important" languages (Romanian and Hungarian), have a slightly poorer consistency upon temperature changes.

\section{Conclusions}
Our findings demonstrate that Large Language Models are not stable repositories of historical matter, but rather highly malleable narrative engines, profoundly sensitive to the format and linguistic context of the query, ultimately drawing three primary conclusions. First, we demonstrate a critical \textbf{representational instability}, where a model's stance on a historical affirmation is not a fixed property but is contingent on the prompt's structure. The frequent "stance reversals" between the forced binary-choice format and the nuanced 1-10 scale prove that the models' outputs are not a reflection of deep, consistent reasoning but are instead artifacts of the specific task they are asked to perform. Second, our findings confirm that LLMs function as \textbf{cultural artifacts}, encoding and reproducing the dominant historiographical and geopolitical biases of their language-specific training data \cite{gururangan2022}. The predictable divergence in answers between Romanian, Hungarian and Russian on intricate topics illustrate that language is not a neutral medium but a powerful vector of bias. Finally, the high variability of answers across identical runs, even for top-tier models highlights a fundamental lack of \textbf{epistemic certainty}. The models do not know history in a human sense, they calculate the most probable continuation of a sequence; this inherent stochasticity, especially on topics with less training data consensus, makes them unreliable for adjudicating sensitive historical debates, bringing up the anticipated problem of a model's dataset size and steadiness \cite{bender2021}. Consequently, we argue that future LLM evaluation must move beyond simple accuracy metrics and prioritize the measurement of consistency and bias as first-class criteria for assessing model trustworthiness.
\section{Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item The current study assumes that contemporary, general-purpose LLMs possess a sufficiently advanced capability to score historical statements and generate elaborate, verbose answers. Future work should investigate how these capabilities vary across models of different scales and architectures, particularly comparing general-purpose models with those fine-tuned specifically on historical or humanities-focused corpora.
    \item Ongoing efforts are focused on further exploring the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm. This involves employing a superiorly-scaled LLM to act as a more advanced curator of the produced essay-type answers, which can then be used to create a high-quality dataset for further fine-tuning and analysis.
    \item Such a fine-tuning procedure could be partitioned into more granular steps. An initial phase could involve using foundational, undergraduate-level materials that are a staple of what is taught in schools (including Romanian history textbooks). A subsequent, more advanced phase would involve fine-tuning on a curated set of international academic articles and bibliographies to instill a multi-perspective understanding of historical events.
%    \item Another idea to be tackled in the future is the study of effects of temperature along various families of LLMs: having only
