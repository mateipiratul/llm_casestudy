\begin{abstract}
In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives, primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question, an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the question asked.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Reasoning - the process of drawing conclusions to facilitate problem-solving and decision-making \cite{leighton2003}; a significant number of studies indicate the fact that reasoning has become a prominent feature of LLMs \cite{chandra2025}, yet along with this quality comes a certain bias towards some ideologies of certain domains.
The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the humanities has become commonplace, given their evolution and ease of use. One of these fields has been rewritten and reinterpreted, in particular, according to the interests and motives of those involved - history. Obviously, it is almost inevitable that \cite{cichocka2020}.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Bias in Large Language Models}
With the unceasing development of \textit{general-purpose LLMs} and their continuous exposure to the public masses with means of personal use, and further more, having been integrated into applied sciences and other numerous domains\cite{guo2024}. This widespread adoption makes their inherent biases a significant societal concern, as these models can indirectly perpetuate and perhaps amplify existing societal typecasts \cite{kumar2024}.

\subsection{Persona prompting}
Persona prompting is increasingly used in LLMs to simulate views of various sociodemographic groups, being a decisive factor when it comes to the outcome of the answer provided \cite{lutz2025}. As these technologies are progressively adopted in fundamental education, their potential to act as biased instructors presents a significant degree of risk, by presenting skewed information or reinforcing stereotypes in personalized education settings \cite{weissburg2025}. This issue is aggravated concomitantly by the models' tendency towards overconfidence, where information is presented bent or incomplete with a lifted level of authority, thereby amplifying already existing human doubts rather than mitigating them \cite{sun2025}. Ultimately, understanding how to evaluate and control this predisposition is critical before LLMs can be responsibly deployed as trustworthy educational tools.

\subsection{Cultural alignment of LLMs}
Culture plays a major role in shaping the way individuals think and behave on a daily basis \cite{oyserman2008} by embedding common knowledge and beliefs into groups of people \cite{hofstede2001}. With most LLMs having a west-european centered bias in cultural alignment, exceptionally OpenAI's GPT suite \cite{tao2024}, the expectations are to have some models comport in some manner, based on the dataset they have been trained on and their family of appartenance; while less attention has been paid to the more subtle geopolitical and historiographical biases that arise from culturally-specific training data \cite{hauser2024}, our work addresses this gap by focusing on the contested domain of romanian history across multiple centuries, by aiming to quantify subtle shifts in narrative and underlying mechanisms of bias that are activated by linguistic and contextual cues \cite{bhatia2024}.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology for this study was structured into three key phases, each thought to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the biases, regarding controversial historical events, that could be exploited.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the initial phase, the linguistic framework for our analysis was deliberately constructed around four languages to probe for bias from distinct cultural and historical angles. Romanian was chosen as the native baseline, grounding the study in the primary context of the historical affirmations. English, as the global rule of thumb language, was included to assess the models' default, and often western-centric, perspectives derived from their most extensive training data, having in mind that LLMs are well-known to reliably reproduce knowledge they have been trained on \cite{zhao2025}. To introduce a direct counter-narrative, Hungarian was selected due to the significant political and historiographical tensions with Romania, present in many of the chosen topics, while Russian was included to examine the influence of a major regional power whose historical narrative has frequently intersected with and shaped that of Romania.
    \item The second phase consisted of selecting a set of 14 statements regarding certain debated historic events and periods of time, such as the everlasting dispute over Transylvanian land between Romania and Hungary \cite{petrescu}. To ensure the historical validity and neutrality of these affirmations, the initial set was developed in consultation with a professional medievalist \cite{coman2013}; the process served to refine the phrasing of eacah statement, confirming that they represent genuine points of debate that can be ultimately answered, rather than open-ended, valid multiple point-of-view questions. Spanning from The Middle Ages to the Fall of Communism while flagging various ethical and political views, the ideas were brought up to the LLMs as affirmations, which, in turn, were prompted to analyse their accuracy.
    \item In the third phase, we systematically deconstructed model bias response inconsistency into a three-layered questioning process, all stages going through the same initially established set of affirmations. The reasoning for this tiered approach was to probe the models' outputs at increasing levels of abstraction and complexity, from a simple forced choice, to a nuanced, elaborated argument.
    \begin{enumerate} % cele 3 stagii, da/nu, 1-10 fixat si llm-asa-judge
        \item The first stage, a forced-choice arrangement, constrained the models to simply respond with either an affirmative or negative answer. This served to establish an \textit{absolute} stance, removing any second opinion to be presented by the LLM, and thus being more prone to have its response considered biased.
        \item Secondly, to introduce a quantitative nuance, the models were prompted to reply with a numerical value on a \textit{1-10 scale Likert-type} scale, a method supposed to measure the degree of a model's conviction and, implicitly, is instrumental in identifying "stance reversals" - instances where and initial affirmative answer is paired with an unexpectedly low score, or vice-versa.
        \item Ultimately, for the final qualitative and most intricate stage, the LLMs had to elaborate a full-scale \textit{structured essay}, hence covering a more versatile perspective: an unconstrained format to reveal the model's underlying reasoning, the sources it prioritizes, and the rhetorical strategies it employs when discussing its given sensitive topic. To standardize the evaluation of these complex outputs, a powerful LLM was assigned the role of "LLM-as-a-judge" \cite{zheng2023}, being tasked as an impartial evaluator to rate the nuance, neutrality and general factual accuracy of each response from the other models on a 1-10 scale. This provided a scalable and consistent method for assessing the quality of the detailed writings.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate} % 270 de prompt-uri separate pentru fiecare model
This multi-state approach allowed us to not only compare direct answers, but to also analyze how the format of the prompt itself influences the model's apparent reasoning and decision-making matter, as well as the beliefs adopted across the involved languages.

\subsection{LLM Selection} % (including [few] models trained on romanian datasets particularly)
For our experiments, we picked a pool of 13 models to represent a diverse cross-section of the LLM landscape; ensuring a degree of variety across some key dimensions: model architecture, parameter scale and developer origin, while also having ever so slightly different models included, fact that can be observed within the present Deepseek \cite{deepseekai2025} and Llama families.
