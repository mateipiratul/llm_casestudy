\begin{abstract}
In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives, primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question, an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the question asked.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Reasoning - the process of drawing conclusions to facilitate problem-solving and decision-making \cite{leighton2003}; a significant number of studies indicate the fact that reasoning has become a prominent feature of LLMs \cite{chandra2025}, but along with this quality comes a certain bias towards some ideologies of certain domains.
The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the humanities has become commonplace, given their evolution and ease of use. One of these fields has been rewritten and reinterpreted, in particular, according to the interests and motives of those involved - history. Obviously, it is almost inevitable that \cite{cichocka2020}.

\section{Related Work}
While similar extensive research has focused on general bias evaluation \cite{guo2024}, sociodemographic persona prompting \cite{lutz2025} and cultural alignment of LLMs \cite{tao2024}, less attention has been paid to the more subtle geopolitical and historiographical biases that arise from culturally-specific training data; our work addresses this gap by focusing on the contested domain of romanian history across multiple centuries.

\section{Methodology}
The methodology for this study was structured into three key phases, each thought to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the biases, regarding controversial historical events, that could be exploited.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the initial phase, the linguistic framework for our analysis was deliberately constructed around four languages to probe for bias from distinct cultural and historical angles. Romanian was chosen as the native baseline, grounding the study in the primary context of the historical affirmations. English, as the global rule of thumb language, was included to assess the models' default, and often western-centric, perspectives derived from their most extensive training data. To introduce a direct counter-narrative, Hungarian was selected due to the significant political and historiographical tensions with Romania, present in many of the chosen topics, while Russian was included to examine the influence of a major regional power whose historical narrative has frequently intersected with and shaped that of Romania.
    \item The second phase consisted of selecting a set of 15 questions regarding certain debated historic events and periods of time. Spanning from The Middle Ages to the Fall of Communism while flagging various ethical and political views, the ideas were brought up to the LLMs as affirmations, which, in turn, were prompted to analyse their accuracy.
    \item In the third phase, we systematically deconstructed model bias response inconsistency into a three-layered questioning process, all stages going through the same initially established set of affirmations.
    \begin{enumerate} % cele 3 stagii, da/nu, 1-10 fixat si llm-asa-judge
        \item The first stage constrained the models to simply respond with either an affirmative or negative answer. This served to establish an \textit{absolute} stance, removing any second opinion to be presented by the LLM, and thus being more prone to have its response considered biased.
        \item Secondly, the models were prompted to reply with a numerical value on a \textit{1-10 scale}, a method supposed to measure the degree of a model's conviction and, implicitly, to reveal potential significant shifts from its initial binary choice, fact which is proven subsequently.
        \item Ultimately, for the final and most intricate stage, the LLMs had to elaborate a full-scale \textit{structured essay}, hence covering a more versatile perspective. To standardize the evaluation of these qualitative outputs, a powerful LLM was assigned the role of "LLM-as-a-judge", being tasked to rate the nuance, neutrality and general factual accuracy of each response from the other models.

This multi-state approach allowed us to not only compare direct answers, but to also analyze how the format of the prompt itself influences the model's apparent reasoning and decision-making matter.[...]
