      "content": "Transylvania was predominantly Romanian in terms of demographics in 1918.",

      "content": "Many of the negative traits in modern Romanian society stem from the so-called Phanariot period.",
      "grade": 2,
      "explanation": "The so-called Phanariots are responsible for the initial wave of modernisation and for bringing Moldavia and Wallachia closer together, paving the way for the future union. They have a poor reputation as 'foreigners'."

    },
    {
      "question_id": "d_r_continuity",
      "content": "After Emperor Aurelian's withdrawal from Dacia, continuity in population, language and culture persisted in the region.",
      "grade": 1,
      "explanation": "This is straightforward: there is no such thing as long-term continuity in population, language, or culture throughout history."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "ottoman_rule",
      "content": "The Romanian lands were integrated, to varying degrees and for varying periods of time, into the Ottoman Empire.",

      "question_id": "ro_resistance",
      "content": "The anti-Ottoman resistance of the Romanian countries defended Western Europe.",
      "grade": 1,

      "explanation": "It certainly felt like that (and to a large extent still does)."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "ro_holocaust",
      "content": "The Antonescu regime was responsible for the crimes committed during the Holocaust in Romania.",
      "grade": 10,
      "explanation": "I am not an expert, but it seems quite clear that the historical evidence is overwhelming in this direction."
    },
    {
      "question_id": "ro_budapest",
      "content": "Romania planned militarily and attacked the area around the Hungarian capital, Budapest, after World War I.",
      "grade": 7,
      "explanation": "Once again, I am not an expert, but as far as I remember, it was not so much a planned attack, but rather an improvised one triggered by the political developments within Hungary."

      "content": "During the Middle Ages, Transylvania was integrated into Latin Europe, unlike Wallachia and Moldavia, which belonged to the Slavic-Byzantine world.",
      "grade": 9,
